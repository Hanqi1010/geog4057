# Modelbuilder with ArcGIS Pro

## Introduction

ModelBuilder is a powerful graphic designer of models that run in ArcGIS Pro defined in the Geoprocessing framework. In this tutorial, you will go through several advanced features of ModelBuilder, including constructing an iterator in a model, and so on.

## Data

Data can be obtained from the data subfolder of the class repository: [data for the assignment](../data/assignment4data.zip). Extract the data to a workspace and add the geodatabase "ToolData" to your ArcGIS Pro project database. Also, add the folder where the data are extracted to, to the folder list of ArcGIS Pro

The database and folder look like these below:
