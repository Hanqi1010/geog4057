# Assignment 7 Work with Rasters

## Part 1: Raster Basics and Properties

### Raster Dataset Selection: (10 pnts)

- Choose a raster dataset of your choice (elevation, satellite imagery, etc.) in a format that ArcPy can handle, such as TIFF (.tif), Imagine Image (.img), JPEG (.jpg), or GRID.
- Load the raster dataset into your ArcPy environment using the arcpy.Raster() function.

### Basic Properties Documentation: (20 pnts)

- Document and discuss the basic properties of the selected raster dataset.
- Determine and record the number of bands in the raster dataset using the bandCount property.
- Explore the spatial resolution, cell size, and pixel bit depth using relevant properties provided by ArcPy.
- Note down the format of the raster dataset and other key properties like the spatial reference system and compression type if available.

## Part 2: Raster Analysis

### Slope Analysis: (10 pnts)

- Apply the Slope analysis using the arcpy.sa.Slope tool on the chosen raster dataset.
- Save the output raster generated after applying the Slope analysis.
Render the output raster in your Jupyter Notebook and discuss the changes observed in the dataset after the Slope analysis. You may explain any topographic insights or landscape information derived from the slope analysis.

### Clipping Operation: (10 pnts)

- Perform a Clipping operation on the raster dataset using the arcpy.sa.Clip tool.
- Save and analyze the clipped raster. Discuss the importance and relevance of the clipped raster in relation to the original dataset. Explain any changes, limitations, or applications of the clipped raster.

## Part 3: Raster Manipulation

### Map Algebra Operators: (10 pnts)

- Utilize map algebra operators to perform a meaningful transformation on the raster dataset.
- Apply arithmetic, bitwise, or boolean operators to create changes in the raster dataset. Document and explain the transformation carried out, and discuss the purpose or utility of the operation.

### Raster Cell Iterator: (15 pnts)

- Demonstrate how to use the Raster Cell Iterator to access and modify individual cell values in the raster dataset.
- Provide explanations of the specific cells you modified, the reasoning behind the modification, and the significance of these changes in the context of the raster data.

## Part 4: NumPy and Raster Integration

### NumPy Array Conversion: (15 pnts)

- Convert the chosen raster dataset to a NumPy array using the arcpy.RasterToNumPyArray() function.
- Use the min(), max(), mean(), and std() functions from Numpy to compute the raster data statistics.
- Discuss the advantages and applications of using NumPy arrays for raster data processing in GIS.

## Submission Guidelines:

- Present a well-documented Jupyter Notebook containing all your code, outputs, observations, and analysis for each part of the assignment. 
- Use the markdown blocks to include detailed explanations and interpretations of the results obtained from various raster operations.
- Provide visualizations wherever necessary to support your analysis.

## Evaluation Criteria:

- Accuracy and completeness of the documentation regarding raster properties and functionalities utilized.
- Effective use of geoprocessing tools and libraries (arcpy.sa and NumPy) for raster manipulation and analysis.
- Critical analysis and interpretations of the transformed raster dataset.

Note: Experiment with various operations, conduct comparisons, and explore the practical utility of each function or tool on the chosen raster dataset to broaden your understanding of working with raster data in ArcPy.
