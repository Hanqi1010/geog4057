# Spatial data analysis with ArcPy


## Exploring and manipulating spatial data

### Checking for the existence of data

#### arcpy.Exists() function

- If your input dataset does not exist, the script will return an error message and prevent the script to be executed further. 
- Using arcpy.Exists() function can help the script check the problem before calling any other functions to use the data. 
- It return a boolean value of True of False
- The Exists() fucntion can determine the existence of feature classes, tables, datasets, workspaces, layers, and so on

```python
import arcpy
print(arcpy.Exists("C:/Data/streams.shp"))
```

#### System path and catalog path

- System paths - recognized by the Windows system
- The existence of a system path can be determined by os.path.exists()
- Catalog paths - recognized by ArcGIS Pro
- For example, the path: "C:/data/study.gdb/final/streets" is a catalog path and cannot be understood by system path functions

#### Base name of a path

- The path name "C:/data/study.gdb/final/streets" has two components: the path name and the base name
- The base name is the feature class name
- However, it might be confusing for "C:/data/study.gdb/final". Is "final" a feature class or a feature dataset?

### Describe() function

- arcpy.Describe() returns a Describe() object
- arcpy.da.Describe() returns a dictionary object
